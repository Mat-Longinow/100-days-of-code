# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 7th, 2020

#### Today's Progress
- React Crash Course - Set up Components and rendered them, passing in some props along the way/beginning to manipulate state

#### Thoughts:
Back up on the horse, let's ride. It felt like React actually started to click some tonight. I remember taking a whack at Reach like a year ago and it felt like Chinese. It's cool to see it start clicking. I think it helped that I spent some time in Pug which does something similar.
