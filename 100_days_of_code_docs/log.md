# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Oct 1, 2019

#### Today's Progress

Getting Started:
- Revamp GitHub project, get it re-synced with local repo
- Brainstorm projects
- Find my WHY or Big Goal

#### Thoughts:
It is crazy thinking that the last time I tried the 100 Day Coding Challenge, was two years ago! Time flies.

While I just had a baby and this might not seem like the ideal time, I think this is perfect because, if I can build motivation in such an up and down time, I can be motivated at any time.

#### Thoughts:
Man, got lost in the weeds a little bit, but I really don't want to take things at face value!
Want to understand the concepts being referenced in things I am reading and eventually things I am coding.
