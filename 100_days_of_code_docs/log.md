# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Dec 28, 2019

#### Today's Progress
- Successfully sent out a text my phone containing the data I scraped from my personal website
- Began learning about promises, callback functions and await
- Found Puppeteer to use for the headless browser I will need in order to login and scrape as planned


#### Thoughts:
Round 3. Let's do this.

### Day 2: Dec 29, 2019

#### Today's Progress
- Figured out how to set local environment variables (thanks to whoever hacked my Twilio account...)
- Figured out how to set up a .gitignore file
- Researched how to set up a promise for synchronous execution of my js


#### Thoughts:
Got stuck on promises, mine isn't working. This is super fun though! Taking small steps forward and learning a lot in the meantime.

### Day 3: Dec 30, 2019

#### Today's Progress
- Got my promise to work correctly! Now texts are being via functions firing in the right order.

#### Thoughts:
Promises are still kicking my butt. One step at a time. My brain hurts.

### Day 4: Jan 1, 2020

#### Today's Progress
- Not much, still working on getting my head wrapped around promises/async/await

#### Thoughts:
Promises are still kicking my butt. One step at a time. My brain hurts. (Yes I meant to duplicate that).

### Day 5: Jan 2, 2020

#### Today's Progress
- Nuked git init and had to figure out how to get around GitHUb's max file limit
- Lost a bunch of my data, spent hours trying to get it back
- Figured out how to set up and begin scraping with Puppeteer

#### Thoughts:
%#$!&$%#$!$%#%$^@#!%36%#$&!#.... And I mean that in the most extreme way possible. I was up till 3am trying to figure out how to push my project upstream.
Had to nuke my git init, and start over. End up losing hours worth of worth and had to re-write everything. Very, very frustrating, but also very good strides ahead.

### Day 6: Jan 3, 2020

#### Today's Progress
- Finished a prototype!
- Cleaned up my files, put some things into their own modules to be exported and called

#### Thoughts:
SO FUN! Currently have round one of the app done. It can log in to my SCE account, scrape data on my current bill, and text it to me. Flawlessly. I LOVE THIS STUFF!
My wife actually told me she was impressed when I showed her. Feeling good :)
