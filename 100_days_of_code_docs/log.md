# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Feb 16th, 2020

#### Today's Progress
- Figured out how to switch between test environment and production for my twilio app
- Reorganized my folder structure/files for the new web scrape

#### Thoughts:
ANOTHER ROUND! Super pumped. Finding that once I hit a milestone, it is hard to push through, so that is good to know.
But I am diving in to my side project and got a lot to unravel.
