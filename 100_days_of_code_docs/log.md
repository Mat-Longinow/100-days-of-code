# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Feb 16th, 2020

#### Today's Progress
- Figured out how to switch between test environment and production for my twilio app
- Reorganized my folder structure/files for the new web scrape

#### Thoughts:
ANOTHER ROUND! Super pumped. Finding that once I hit a milestone, it is hard to push through, so that is good to know.
But I am diving in to my side project and got a lot to unravel.

### Day 2: Feb 23rd, 2020

#### Today's Progress
- Learned the differences between session storage, local storage and cookies
- Began setting up session storage with text convo so I can have a conversation with the user

#### Thoughts:
So cool! Local/session/cookie storage always intimidated me, but turns out it isn't all that crazy after all.

### Day 3: Feb 24rd, 2020

#### Today's Progress
- Refactored code to take out conversation back and forth into its own module

#### Thoughts:
Stuck, stuck, stuck. Can't get the text to send from another linked module even though the same code executes within the root app.js file. But man am I having fun!

### Day 4: Feb 25th, 2020

#### Today's Progress
- Built out the text conversation back and forth to take in parameters
- Store parameters in a separate file to be referenced
- Fixed bug with Twilio, needed to have the headers and stuff set at the bottom of each message

#### Thoughts:
So fun! It's amazing to see tangible results like having a text conversation that responds back to you according to what you tell it.

### Day 5: Feb 26th, 2020

#### Today's Progress
- Project Planning

#### Thoughts:
Didn't do any coding, but sat down and sudo coded out the project. First time sudo coding! Interesting. Used a gsheet.

### Day 6: Feb 29th, 2020

#### Today's Progress
- Refactored code to split text converstion into 5 different search pages
- Set up express-sessions to have custom session id's for the different searches
- Completed the text conversation back and forth for search 1

#### Thoughts:
Lots of good progress tonight! Programmed for 2.5 hours like it was nuthin'. Really am enjoying express-sessions so far.
