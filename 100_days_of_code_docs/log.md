### Day 2: June 21st, 2020

#### Today's Progress
- Learned about .bind() and this inside of JS and objects

#### Thoughts:
Another round, but this is day two! So that's good. Man, some parts of JS are difficult. Also, React is not quite as easy as I imagined, but I imagine that it is the whole "feels hard until you learn it and then realize it's not all that bad" concept.

### Day 3: June 23rd, 2020

#### Today's Progress
- More reasearch on bind, this and function scoping

#### Thoughts:
React is tricky, though I have mainly been stuck in my walkthrough by having to dive in and understand some more scope stuff with functions and specifically this, bind and function scoping.
