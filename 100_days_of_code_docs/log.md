# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Dec 28, 2019

#### Today's Progress
- Successfully sent out a text my phone containing the data I scraped from my personal website
- Began learning about promises, callback functions and await
- Found Puppeteer to use for the headless browser I will need in order to login and scrape as planned


#### Thoughts:
Round 3. Let's do this.

### Day 2: Dec 29, 2019

#### Today's Progress
- Figured out how to set local environment variables (thanks to whoever hacked my Twilio account...)
- Figured out how to set up a .gitignore file
- Researched how to set up a promise for synchronous execution of my js


#### Thoughts:
Got stuck on promises, mine isn't working. This is super fun though! Taking small steps forward and learning a lot in the meantime.

### Day 3: Dec 30, 2019

#### Today's Progress
- Got my promise to work correctly! Now texts are being via functions firing in the right order.

#### Thoughts:
Promises are still kicking my butt. One step at a time. My brain hurts.

### Day 4: Jan 1, 2020

#### Today's Progress
- Not much, still working on getting my head wrapped around promises/async/await

#### Thoughts:
Promises are still kicking my butt. One step at a time. My brain hurts. (Yes I meant to duplicate that).
