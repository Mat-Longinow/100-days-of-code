# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Dec 28, 2019

#### Today's Progress
- Successfully sent out a text my phone containing the data I scraped from my personal website
- Began learning about promises, callback functions and await
- Found Puppeteer to use for the headless browser I will need in order to login and scrape as planned


#### Thoughts:
Round 3. Let's do this.

### Day 2: Dec 29, 2019

#### Today's Progress
- Figured out how to set local environment variables (thanks to whoever hacked my Twilio account...)
- Figured out how to set up a .gitignore file
- Researched how to set up a promise for synchronous execution of my js


#### Thoughts:
Got stuck on promises, mine isn't working. This is super fun though! Taking small steps forward and learning a lot in the meantime.
