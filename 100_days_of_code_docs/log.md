# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 12th, 2020

#### Today's Progress
- Fixed some bugs in the data converter

#### Thoughts:
Glad to be back at it again. Login creds were failing so need to reach out and see what is going on. In the meantime, took a look at my second project after this. Need to learn some React!
