# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Oct 1, 2019

#### Today's Progress

Getting Started:
- Revamp GitHub project, get it re-synced with local repo
- Brainstorm projects
- Find my WHY or Big Goal

#### Thoughts:
It is crazy thinking that the last time I tried the 100 Day Coding Challenge, was two years ago! Time flies.

While I just had a baby and this might not seem like the ideal time, I think this is perfect because, if I can build motivation in such an up and down time, I can be motivated at any time.

### Day 2: Oct 2, 2019

#### Today's Progress

Getting Started:
- Brainstormed ideas for revamp of Portfolio
- Started with the first one (Create Comments Section on Blog Posts)
- Mapped out action steps
- Began research on creating Node.js Env
   - Setting up Node.js Server
   - What is a Web Server
   - Web Architecture 101

#### Thoughts:
Man, got lost in the weeds a little bit, but I really don't want to take things at face value!
Want to understand the concepts being referenced in things I am reading and eventually things I am coding.

### Day 3: Oct 3, 2019

#### Today's Progress
- Node.js & Express.js Implementation Planning
- Set Up Digital Ocean Web Server To Prep For Deployment

#### Thoughts:
I totally worked backwards here, but I had a big question mark about how I would actually "run" my app on the internet.
This affects the way I build the site, because if I am going to load it dynamically, I needed to understand how that would all work out. Now I know!

### Day 4: Oct 4, 2019

#### Today's Progress
- Set up Trello board to create a poor man's Jira board
- Configured WebServer, install Node, npm, nodemon, express
- Set up boilterplate for my Portfolio revamp
#### Thoughts:
Decided today that I need to redo the entire skeleton of my portfolio to be dynamically loaded using Node and Express. So... this became a whole lot more complicated. Should be fun though!
