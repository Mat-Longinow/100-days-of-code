# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Mar 30, 2020

#### Today's Progress
- Debugged ngrok/Twilio
- Found out how to read ngrok logs (SUPER helpful)
- Built out search #3

#### Thoughts:
I found out I am a 4 ont the enneagram. No wonder this is round 5. But man is that motivating.
App wise, not sure how I am going to get an actual flight to test with?
