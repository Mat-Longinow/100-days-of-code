# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Oct 1, 2019

#### Today's Progress

Getting Started:
- Revamp GitHub project, get it re-synced with local repo
- Brainstorm projects
- Find my WHY or Big Goal

#### Thoughts:
It is crazy thinking that the last time I tried the 100 Day Coding Challenge, was two years ago! Time flies.

While I just had a baby and this might not seem like the ideal time, I think this is perfect because, if I can build motivation in such an up and down time, I can be motivated at any time.

### Day 2: Oct 2, 2019

#### Today's Progress

Getting Started:
- Brainstormed ideas for revamp of Portfolio
- Started with the first one (Create Comments Section on Blog Posts)
- Mapped out action steps
- Began research on creating Node.js Env
   - Setting up Node.js Server
   - What is a Web Server
   - Web Architecture 101

#### Thoughts:
Man, got lost in the weeds a little bit, but I really don't want to take things at face value!
Want to understand the concepts being referenced in things I am reading and eventually things I am coding.

### Day 3: Oct 3, 2019

#### Today's Progress
- Node.js & Express.js Implementation Planning
- Set Up Digital Ocean Web Server To Prep For Deployment

#### Thoughts:
I totally worked backwards here, but I had a big question mark about how I would actually "run" my app on the internet.
This affects the way I build the site, because if I am going to load it dynamically, I needed to understand how that would all work out. Now I know!

### Day 4: Oct 4, 2019

#### Today's Progress
- Set up Trello board to create a poor man's Jira board
- Configured WebServer, install Node, npm, nodemon, express
- Set up boilterplate for my Portfolio revamp
#### Thoughts:
Decided today that I need to redo the entire skeleton of my portfolio to be dynamically loaded using Node and Express. So... this became a whole lot more complicated. Should be fun though!


### Day 5: Oct 5, 2019

#### Today's Progress
- Found and started Express crash course

#### Thoughts:
Got stonewalled a little. Realized I didn't know as much about Express as I thought, so I am watching a little Crash Course on it to understand how to use it better.


### Day 6: Oct 7, 2019

#### Today's Progress
- Learned a ton:
   - Routing
      - Handlers/Callback Functions
      - HTTP Methods
      - Paths (specifically Route Parameters)

#### Thoughts:
So many light bulbs happened tonight! So much fun. Routing became so much more clear. Not a lot of coding, but I sat down and read through Express' documentation on Routing and... it clicked! Great feeling.


### Day 7: Oct 8, 2019

#### Today's Progress
- Leet Code Example
- Walking through Programming concepts with my friend Nick V.K.

#### Thoughts:
Processing out my programming journey with close friends in coding is always SO helpful. Gives me bearing and validates my journey.

### Day 8: Oct 9, 2019

#### Today's Progress
- Worked on boiler plate
   - Set up public directory using express routing

- Continued with express tutorial
- More express/Node.js researching!

#### Thoughts:
Sometimes things can feel a bit slow. I am really trying to make sure I am understanding every part of the code I am writing (or at least the large majority of it).
Also, excited for the progress I am making and how much I feel I am learning!
