# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Mar 30, 2020

#### Today's Progress
- Debugged ngrok/Twilio
- Found out how to read ngrok logs (SUPER helpful)
- Built out search #3

#### Thoughts:
I found out I am a 4 ont the enneagram. No wonder this is round 5. But man is that motivating.
App wise, not sure how I am going to get an actual flight to test with?

### Day 2: April 3, 2020

#### Today's Progress
- Creted converter
- Learned more about date/time manipulation

#### Thoughts:
Man, tonight was awesome. I programmed for like 2.5 hours and loved it. Working with how to manipulate strings and date/times was super interesting.

### Day 3: April 5, 2020

#### Today's Progress
- Hooked up converter to scrape and tested passing in data to converter to see how it outputted

#### Thoughts:
Data converter worked like a charm! Interesting moment tonight where I was wondering where I should try and organize all my locations of scripts/var declarations within the file. Still not entirely sure how to organize code super well.

### Day 4: April 7, 2020

#### Today's Progress
- Hooked up up text convo to pass real data being oulled from texts to scrape

#### Thoughts:
Felt pretty wiped tonight, but things went pretty smoothly actually. Getting very close to actually having a working prototype.
