# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Feb 16th, 2020

#### Today's Progress
- Figured out how to switch between test environment and production for my twilio app
- Reorganized my folder structure/files for the new web scrape

#### Thoughts:
ANOTHER ROUND! Super pumped. Finding that once I hit a milestone, it is hard to push through, so that is good to know.
But I am diving in to my side project and got a lot to unravel.

### Day 2: Feb 23rd, 2020

#### Today's Progress
- Learned the differences between session storage, local storage and cookies
- Began setting up session storage with text convo so I can have a conversation with the user

#### Thoughts:
So cool! Local/session/cookie storage always intimidated me, but turns out it isn't all that crazy after all.

### Day 3: Feb 24rd, 2020

#### Today's Progress
- Refactored code to take out conversation back and forth into its own module

#### Thoughts:
Stuck, stuck, stuck. Can't get the text to send from another linked module even though the same code executes within the root app.js file. But man am I having fun!
