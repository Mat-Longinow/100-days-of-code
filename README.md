# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge!!

## About My Challenge

So take two, two years late! I kinda like my original README, so I think I will keep it:
 
Hey guys, over the course of the last 6 months or so, I have really taken personal coding development more seriously and really pushed myself to learn and grow. Some fruit of that work has been the development of my GitHub profile, and the creation of my personal website: [myprogrammingjourney.com](http://www.myprogrammingjourney.com).

It can be easy to either get stuck, apathetic or just busy, when it comes to self development, so I have joined a challenge that many of my fellow coding enthuists do to push themselves to learn: [The #100DaysOfCode Challenge](http://100daysofcode.com/). This is something created by someone in a very similar place as me, and I am jumping in for the same reason: to push myself to learn and grow.

~~I will do a mixture of building projects through Stack Social's online courses on Full Stack Web Development, as well as building my own projects as I test out new technologies.~~ [I am now going to find some other projects to work on, stay tuned] You can track with what I do each day (if you are interested) through my [log](log.md).

So, here is to coding! 100 days, here I come...

## Big Goal
This is my WHY, the driving force behind my 100 Day Challenge, and ultimately, where I really want to go with my programming learning.

## Roadmap
You can check out my strategy of what ideas and goals I will be running towards in my [Roadmap](roadmap.md)
