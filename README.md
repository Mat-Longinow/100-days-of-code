# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge.

## About My Challenge

Hey guys, over the course of the last 6 months or so, I have really taken personal coding development more seriously and really pushed myself to learn and grow. Some fruit of that work has been the development of my GitHub profile, and the creation of my personal website: [myprogrammingjourney.com](http://www.myprogrammingjourney.com).

It can be easy to either get stuck, apathetic or just busy, when it comes to self development, so I have joined a challenge that many of my fellow coding enthuists do to push themselves to learn: The #100DaysOfCode Challenge.

This is something created by someone in a very similar place as me (check below under rules for more info about the original challenge), and I am hoping jumping in for the same reason: to push myself to learn and grow.

I will do a mixture of building projects through Stack Social's online courses on Full Stack Web Development, as well as building my own projects as I test out new technologies.

So, here is to coding! 100 days, here I come...
