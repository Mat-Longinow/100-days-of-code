# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Oct 1, 2019

####Today's Progress

Getting Started:
- Revamp GitHub project
- Brainstorm projects
- Find my WHY or Big Goal
- Begin setting up boilerplate

**Big Goal**

I want to be able to take on clients on the side to make additional income to help pay off debt and save for our growing family. I also want to set myself up to apply for a programming position.

In order to do this, I need to start making client-like websites that are good enough that people would pay for them.



####Thoughts:
It is crazy thinking that the last time I tried the 100 Day Coding Challenge, was two years ago! Time flies.

While I just had a baby and this might not seem like the ideal time, I think this is perfect since if I can build motivation in such an up and down time, I can be motivated at any time.
