# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Sep 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Setup the GitHub fork for my challenge and rearranged/edited files. Also made some minor edits to my Budget project.

**Thoughts:** I am excited to begin! Who knows what I will be able to accomplish in the next 100 days, but I am excited to buckle down and focus on my self-development journey.

### Day 2: Sep 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Made some headway on my Budget project. Mainly getting the Bank Info widget sorted out (design wise anyways). Coding is so fun!

**Thoughts:** Had some troubles with Bootstrap's pull-right interacting with the button, it made it get knocked out of it's parent element. Had to do a hack instead :( I hate using unsunstainable solutions...

### Day 3: Sep 7, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on my Budget project and tried to make some headway in React learning.

**Thoughts:** Got really frustrated with the React course I started with Skill Stack. The teacher was not explaing a lot of what he was doing with his code, quickly moving through lots of lines of React he was writing, which gave me no context of how to pull those ideas out and manipulate them for my own use in other places.

### Day 4: Sep 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Working on my personal website today. Specifically getting Google Analytics to work on it (which it hadn't before), as well as working on my contact page.

**Thoughts:** Super pumped to get GA to work! It was a pain the last time I tried it. Oddly enough, I just recopied it over and that did the trick. Strange...
