# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Sep 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Setup the GitHub fork for my challenge and rearranged/edited files. Also made some minor edits to my Budget project.

**Thoughts:** I am excited to begin! Who knows what I will be able to accomplish in the next 100 days, but I am excited to buckle down and focus on my self-development journey.

### Day 2: Sep 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Made some headway on my Budget project. Mainly getting the Bank Info widget sorted out (design wise anyways). Coding is so fun!

**Thoughts:** Had some troubles with Bootstrap's pull-right interacting with the button, it made it get knocked out of it's parent element. Had to do a hack instead :( I hate using unsunstainable solutions...
